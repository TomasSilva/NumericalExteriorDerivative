# Numerical Exterior Derivative – Numerical Demo in ℝ³  

This repository accompanies the paper **“The exterior derivative and the mean value equality
in $\mathbb{R}^n$”**, which revisits classical results in vector calculus and analysis from a generalized perspective. The central idea is to reinterpret the **exterior derivative** as a measure of *infinitesimal flux*, leading to:  

- A higher-dimensional analogue of the **Mean Value Theorem** for differential \(k\)-forms.  
- A natural formulation of **Stokes’ theorem** that parallels the exact hypotheses of the **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**, even without requiring full \(C^1\) smoothness of the form.

## What’s in this repository?  

- **Numerical Demo in $\mathbb{R}^3$**  
  An implementation of our proposed algorithm for computing the **exterior derivative** of differential forms in three dimensions.  
  - Requires only **black-box access** to the differential form.  
  - Does **not** rely on mesh discretization or explicit symbolic expressions.  
  - Provides practical numerical experiments to illustrate the theory.  

- **Examples**  
  - Exterior differentiation of sample 1-forms and 2-forms in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
